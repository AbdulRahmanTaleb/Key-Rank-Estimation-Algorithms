# Key-Rank-Estimation-Algorithms
This repository contains the implementations in c language, of Key Rank Estimation Algorithms presented in the paper "Tighter, faster, simpler
side-channel security evaluations beyond computing power" by Bernstein et al.. 
The algorithms aim to estimate the rank of the secret key used during a block cipher, given different scores for all possible subkeys.
